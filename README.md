# Alpha Gomoku

- This is a gomoku game with web front end and python back end
- You can play with AI or replay an old game with history JSON
- Rules: 6 stone does not win and black can do 3-3 and 4-4
- The AI is a complicated unbalanced non-zero-sum tree search agent

# To install and play

- Make sure you have installed [**pypy**](http://pypy.org/), the fastest python interpreter
- To start the game, run `pypy main.py` in terminal and navigate in your browser to `localhost:8000`
- There are a lot of useful information displayed in the terminal
- The AI can spend very long time thinking (the longest I've encountered is 4 minutes)
- Have fun! (Bug report or comments: shoot me an [email](mailto:tak_us@hotmail.com)!)
