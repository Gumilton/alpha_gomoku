# Gomoku AI

- This is a gomoku game with web front end and python back end
- The AI is currently a depth-6 Minimax with Alpha Beta Pruning

# Current Problems

+ Sometimes the AI does not "long" his 3/4 to win the game directly, should I use gamma?
+ The AI still misses some useful moves, shall I improve action selection?
+ The AI does random dead-4 extensions which are not so useful
+ Can I still do trivial performance improvements?
